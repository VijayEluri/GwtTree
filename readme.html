<h1>GWT Tree</h1>
<p>
   The GWT Tree Add-On demonstrates several interesting capabilities of the Add-On API.  It shows using both dynamic
   trees (each set of children are loaded only when the parent is expanded) and static trees (the entire tree is determined
   and loaded into the browser at once).  The static tree mode builds a sparse tree in the UI containing only the paths
   down to equipment that contain analog trend sources.  (If desired, the user can specify trend names to filter down to
   instead of all analog trends.)  For the 24 hour period of the day selected on the calendar, it then retrieves the
   trends from the selected (checked) equipments, integrates the values (which may or may not make much sense for the
   given trend source) and shows a 3D bar graph (generated using JFreeChart) of the result.
</p>
<p>
   The user interface for this Add-On is implemented using the <a target="_blank" href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">Google Web Toolkit</a>.
   This is a Java based tool for generating JavaScript enabled rich web applications.  This is the tool enabling most of
   the UI, including the tree and calendar.  The tool makes it easy for someone with knowledge and experience developing
   Swing applications to develop web applications.  Some knowledge of HTML and CSS is still required, but little or no
   JavaScript knowledge is required.
</p>
<p>
   The graphs shown in this Add-On are generated using <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/">JFreeChart</a>,
   a free Java charting library.
</p>
<h2>Try it out</h2>
<p>
   Deploy the GWT Tree sample add-on by executing the 'deploy' task and starting (if necessary) the server.
   Note that this sample uses analog trend sources, so you need a system with at least one such trend source and have
   some trend data for this sample to work correctly.
</p>
<p>
   Browse to <span class="examp">http://yourserver/gwttree</span> (<a target="_blank" href="http://localhost/gwttree">open on localhost</a>).
   This should present a login page. Log in with any valid operator and password.
</p>
<p>
   After the tree appears on the bottom left, select (check) some equipment from the tree.  The right side will then show
   all trend sources in the selected equipment as tabs.  Below the tab a graph of the calculated integration for the named
   trend in each checked equipment will be displayed.  Select a previous day on the calendar to change the graph.
   The "Change Tree Options..." button shows a dialog allowing you to change between the dynamic tree (default) and the static tree.
   Futher, the dialog allows you to limit the analog trend sources found by the add-on based on thier name.
</p>
<h2>Important Lessons</h2>
<p>
   <span class="examp">GraphServlet.totalDemand</span> processes a span of trend data given a trend source and a date range.
   This uses the inner class <span class="examp">GraphServlet.Integrator</span> as a
   <a target="_blank" href="../../docs/javadoc/index.html?com/controlj/green/addonsupport/access/trend/TrendProcessor.html">TrendProcessor</a>.
   to do this.  This is a good example of a TrendProcessor performing a calculation over a range of trend data with
   special handling for holes in the data.
</p>
<p>
   <span class="examp">TreeServiceImpl</span> shows how to use a
   <a target="_blank" href="../../docs/javadoc/index.html?com/controlj/green/addonsupport/access/TreeVisitor.html">TreeVisitor</a>
   to easily build a tree of objects that represents a sparse view of the original tree.  In this case, we are looking for equipment
   with analog trend sources.  Any area that doesn't have a descendant that contains such an equipment is not useful
   to show in the tree.  This sample shows how about a dozen lines of code can prune these unnecessary tree branches and create a tree
   of custom objects that can be remoted via GWT for use in rendering the user interface.
